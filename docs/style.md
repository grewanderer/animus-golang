# Documentation style

Control, not a demo. Documentation is concise and deterministic.

## Do
- Use short sections and lists.
- Prefer explicit contracts and invariants.
- State scope and outcome clearly.
- Use ASCII only.

## Do not
- Add marketing fluff.
- Hide defaults or side effects.
- Describe speculative runtime behavior as current.

## Tone
- Enterprise and security-forward.
- Determinism-first.
- On-prem and private cloud ready.
