# Ambiguity Log

This document records places where the source wording was ambiguous and required a conservative interpretation.

## AL-001: Document status lifecycle (Draft -> Review -> Approved)

- Source: "Status" blocks in the original documents.
- Ambiguity: the sequence is listed without an explicit current status.
- Conservative interpretation: the sequence is treated as the document lifecycle, not a statement of current status.
- Reflected in: [00-introduction-and-scope.md](../enterprise/00-introduction-and-scope.md) (Section 00.3).
