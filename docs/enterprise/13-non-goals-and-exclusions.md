# 13. Non-Goals and Explicit Exclusions

The following items are explicitly out of scope for Animus Datalab:

- Built-in Git hosting or full IDE replacement.
- A full inference platform (export to external systems is supported).
- A standalone Feature Store product (interfaces may be integrated).

These exclusions are architectural boundaries and must not be treated as temporary gaps.
