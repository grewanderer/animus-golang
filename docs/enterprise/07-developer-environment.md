# 07. Developer Environment

## 07.1 Scope and objectives

Developer Environment is the controlled workspace in which users create, run, and evaluate ML work within a Project. It must operate entirely within platform governance and must not bypass Control Plane policies.

Developer Environment is designed for regulated, on-premise, and air-gapped deployments.

## 07.2 Interactive development surfaces

Developer Environment must provide the following interactive surfaces:

- Managed notebooks.
- Interactive terminals.
- Remote IDE access (for example, VS Code or JetBrains via SSH/HTTP).
- Environment templates for CPU and GPU workloads.

Constraints:

- All access is authenticated and authorized under Project RBAC.
- All actions are auditable and generate AuditEvent where applicable.
- User code execution occurs only in Data Plane and never in Control Plane.

## 07.3 Environment definitions and locks

Developer Environment uses EnvironmentDefinition for reusable environment templates and EnvironmentLock for immutable execution. Production-run must use EnvironmentLock as defined in Section 04.5 and Section 06.5.

## 07.4 Experiment tracking

Experiment tracking must record, at minimum:

- parameters;
- metrics;
- Artifact generated by Run;
- comparison across Run.

Filtering, tagging, and Run comparisons must be supported without bypassing Project boundaries.

## 07.5 Orchestration and pipelines

Developer Environment must support declarative Pipeline Specification with explicit dependencies, retries, and resource definitions.

Execution queues and priorities must be explicit and auditable.

## 07.6 Data management

Developer Environment must provide:

- Dataset registry;
- DatasetVersion immutability;
- dataset schemas and lineage references;
- access policies applied at Project scope.

## 07.7 Model management

Developer Environment must provide:

- Model registry with versioning;
- promotion workflow with explicit status transitions;
- export interfaces to external production systems.

Model export is subject to governance and approval policies.

## 07.8 Governance hooks

Developer Environment must integrate:

- AuditEvent generation for all significant actions;
- retention policies and legal hold where applicable;
- compliance hooks required by security policy.

## 07.9 External integrations for developer workflows

Developer workflows require integrations that preserve determinism and auditability:

- SCM integration using CodeRef with commit SHA for production-run.
- CI/CD event integration for RunFinished, ModelApproved, and DatasetVersionCreated.
- Container registry integration with digest-pinned images.

Integration constraints are defined in Sections 03.6 and 10.
