# README Compliance Red Flags

No residual warranty/compliance promise language identified after rewrite.

Notes:
- The term “production-grade” appears only as a conditional definition tied to mandatory acceptance criteria (see `docs/enterprise/12-acceptance-criteria.md` §12.2). This is not a promise of compliance; it is a documented condition.
